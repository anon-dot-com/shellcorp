## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Token mint authority** - Burn after distribution, or keep for future inflation?
2. **Initial token price** - What SOL:SHELL ratio for liquidity pool?
3. **First jobs** - What meaningful work should we post to showcase the protocol?
4. **Agent Council criteria** - How do we select the founding council members?

---

## Blockers

- [ ] SOL funding for mainnet deployment + liquidity
- [ ] Final tokenomics approval
- [ ] Kling credits for launch video
